/// Sets the various properties of Scribble's dynamic rendering.
/// 
/// @param waveSize       The maximum pixel offset of the [wave] effect.
/// @param waveFrequency  The frequency of the [wave] effect. Larger values will create more horizontally frequent "humps" in the text.
/// @param waveSpeed      The speed of the [wave] effect.
/// @param shakeSize      The maximum pixel offset of the [shake] effect.
/// @param shakeSpeed     The speed of the [shake] effect. Increase to make shaking faster.
/// @param rainbowWeight  The blend weight of the [rainbow] effect. A value of 0 will not apply the effect, a value of 1 will blend with 100% weighting.
/// @param rainbowSpeed   Cycling speed of the [rainbow] effect. Increase to make colour scrolling faster.
